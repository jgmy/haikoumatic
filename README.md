# haikoumatic
Herramienta para la creaci√≥n automatizada de haikus. / Spanish haiku automated creation tool.

## Inspiration
My main inspiration was the automatic haiku that substituted network errors in the "Haiku" browser of the BeOS operating system.

## Previous attempts
You can see a previous attempt at http://jgmoyay.apagada.com/juegospoe/haikoumatic.html

I also made a purely android widget app before I started using processing.

## Compiling
You can compile this project with processing. I recommend compiling it as android wallpaper.

## Binary
I will put a signed binary at /bin in this repository. Take into account that activating an android wallpaper is a complex task, the option to so so is hidden on some phones.
